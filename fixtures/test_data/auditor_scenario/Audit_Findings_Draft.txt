FINDINGS REQUIRING MANAGEMENT RESPONSE

Finding 1: Capital Expenditure Documentation [MEDIUM PRIORITY]

During our review, we identified equipment purchases totaling $180,000 that:
- Were approved under CEO discretionary authority
- Lack complete supporting documentation
- Do not appear in the approved capital budget
- Are not reflected in Q3 cash flow statement

The expenditures include:
- CNC Machine: $95,000 (Invoice #INV-2023-0847, approved by J. Smith)
- Laser Cutter: $45,000 (Invoice #INV-2023-0923, approved by J. Smith)  
- Quality Control Equipment: $40,000 (Invoice #INV-2023-0956, approved by J. Smith)

TOTAL: $180,000

Management Response Required:
1. Provide purchase authorization documentation
2. Explain absence from cash flow projections
3. Reconcile with capital budget

Finding 2: Revenue Recognition Timing [LOW PRIORITY]

Board minutes reference Q3 revenue of $2,150,000, while Income Statement 
shows full-year revenue of $8,500,000 (implying Q3 actual was $2,125,000).

Difference: $25,000

This appears to be a timing difference related to one large customer order
recognized in different periods for management vs. GAAP reporting.

Recommendation: Clarify revenue recognition policies for board reporting.

Finding 3: Debt Refinancing Documentation [INFORMATIONAL]

Board approved debt refinancing from $1,800,000 to $2,100,000 on September 15.
As of October 5, loan documents are still pending final execution.

Current balance sheet shows $1,800,000 (unchanged).

No action required - transaction in progress.
