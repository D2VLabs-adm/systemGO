Subject: Urgent: CNC Machine Purchase Approval

John,

MachineWorks is offering a 15% discount if we commit by end of week.
The CNC machine we discussed is $95,000 (normally $112,000).

This is within your discretionary authority (<$100K) and critical for 
Q4 production ramp. Can you approve today so we don't miss the discount?

Invoice will be coded to Equipment CapEx.

Thanks,
Sarah

Approved. Great deal!

However, I thought our policy required board approval for anything >$50K?
Should we run this by the board first, or document this as emergency approval?

You're right about the policy, but your discretionary authority is up to $200K
per our updated bylaws (approved last year). 

I'll add a note to the board minutes for transparency. We'll disclose it at
the September meeting.

Processing the order now!

John & Sarah,

At last week's board meeting, you mentioned $180,000 in equipment purchases 
under CEO discretionary authority. Can you provide details?

I couldn't find these in the Q3 cash flow statement that was presented. 
Where are they reflected?

Also, if your discretionary authority is $200K, shouldn't purchases approaching
that limit be disclosed proactively to the board rather than after the fact?

Thanks,
Robert

Robert,

Valid questions. Here's the breakdown:

1. CNC Machine: $95,000 (Aug 15 - Invoice INV-2023-0847)
2. Laser Cutter: $45,000 (Sep 8 - Invoice INV-2023-0923)
3. QC Equipment: $40,000 (Sep 12 - Invoice INV-2023-0956)

Total: $180,000

These weren't in the Q3 cash flow because:
- Aug/Sep purchases will be paid in Q4 (60-day terms)
- Accounting will reflect in Q4 cash flow

You're right about proactive disclosure. Going forward, we'll report any 
discretionary spending >$100K to the board monthly rather than quarterly.

I'll have the detailed report ready by Sep 30 as requested.

Sarah & John,

As Board Chair, I want to echo Robert's concerns but also recognize that
these purchases appear to be legitimate operational needs within policy.

For the discretionary spending report, please include:
- Full invoices and approvals
- Business justification
- Why each was time-sensitive/couldn't wait for board approval

This will help us refine our governance policies.

Emily Davis
Board Chair
